    "# Collaborative Review Task 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you are required to complete a Collaborative review task, which is designed to test your ability to apply and analyze the knowledge you have learned during the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Returns\n",
    "- Download 1-2 years of price history of a stock.\n",
    "- Compute its log return.\n",
    "- Compute the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and excess kurtosis of its log return.\n",
    "- Repeat for a second stock.\n",
    "- Compute the covariance and the correlation. Explain their difference. How do you convert one to the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Build your own transition\n",
    "- Divide the data into 2 uneven parts: the first part is 80% of your data, and the second part is 20%.\n",
    "- Categorize each day in the 1-2 year price history as belonging to one of four categories:\n",
    "    - Both stocks up\n",
    "    - Stock #1 up, stock #2 down.\n",
    "    - Stock #1 down, stock #2 up.\n",
    "    - Both stocks down\n",
    "- Build a transition matrix of portfolio direction that shows your portfolio in four scenerios:\n",
    "    - From moving together to moving together. That means starting from uu or dd & going to uu or dd.\n",
    "    - From moving together to moving apart. That means starting from uu or dd & going to ud or du.\n",
    "    - From moving apart to moving together. That means starting from ud or du & going to uu or dd.\n",
    "    - From moving apart to moving apart. That means starting from ud or du & going to ud or du.\n",
    "- How similar is the transition matrix from the first group to the second group?\n",
    "- Is the process Markovian?\n",
