    "Schmidt Company is a manufacturer of watches. It performs all of its own accounting, human resources and secretarial services. The company was founded 20 years ago by J.S. Schmidt, who is currently the Chief Executive Officer, largest shareholder, and chairmain of the board. Mr Schmidt's salary is twice as high as the median salary for people with similar expertise, responsibility, and experience.\n",

They estimate that Schmidt's accounting, human resources and secretarial services could be merged with Mauer's saving \\$250,000 per year in expenses. If Schmidt's salary were reduced to the median, \\$100,000 would be saved. Schmidt Company pays income tax of 20%. Schmidt Company reported Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) of \\$475,000 in the most recent year.\n",

Currently, Schmidt has debt of \\$2,400,000 on which it is paying 6% interest. Schmidt's Weighted-Average Cost of Capital (WACC) has been calculated as 8.1%.
